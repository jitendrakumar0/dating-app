                        <p>Dating is always striving to improve the Service and bring you additional functionality that you will find engaging and useful. This means we may add new product features or enhancements from time to time as well as remove some features, and if these actions do not materially affect your rights or obligations, we may not provide you with notice before taking them. We may even suspend the Service entirely, in which event we will notify you in advance unless extenuating circumstances, such as safety or security concerns, prevent us from doing so.</p>
                        <p>The easiest way to terminate your account is to follow the instructions under "Settings" in the Service. Of course, you retain other termination options. <strong>However, if you use a third party payment account such as Apple’s App Store or iTunes Store, as applicable (“App Store”) or the Google Play Store, you will need to manage in app purchases through such an account to avoid additional billing.</strong> Dating may terminate your account at any time without notice if it believes that you have violated this Agreement. Upon such termination, you will not be entitled to any refund for purchases.</p>
                        <p>After your account is terminated, this Agreement will terminate, except that the following provisions will still apply to you and Dating: Section 4, Section 5, and Sections 12 through 19.</p>
                        <p>For residents of the Republic of Korea, except in the case where we reasonably consider that (i) giving notice is legally prohibited (for instance, when providing notice would either violate applicable laws, regulations, or orders from regulatory authorities or compromise an ongoing investigation conducted by a regulatory authority) or (ii) any notice may cause harm to you, third parties, Dating, and/or our affiliates (for instance, when providing notice harms the security of the Service), we will without delay notify you of the reason for taking the relevant step.</p>

                        <p>Though Dating strives to encourage a respectful member experience through features like the double opt-in that allows members to communicate only after they have both indicated interest in one another, Dating is not responsible for the conduct of any member on or off of the Service.

In addition, you agree to review and follow Dating’s Safety Tips prior to using the Service.

                        <p><strong>Generally.</strong> From time to time, Dating may offer products and services for purchase ("in app purchases") through the App Store, Google Play Store, carrier billing, Dating direct billing or other payment platforms authorized by Dating. If you choose to make an in app purchase, you will be prompted to confirm your purchase with the applicable payment provider, and your method of payment (be it your card or a third party account such as the Google Play Store or App Store (your "Payment Method")) will be charged for the in app purchase at the prices displayed to you for the service(s) you've selected as well as any sales or similar taxes that may be imposed on your payments, and you authorize Dating or the third party account, as applicable, to charge you.</p>
                        <p class="text-black fw-600">Auto-Renewal; Automatic Card Payment</p>
                        <p>If you purchase an auto-recurring periodic subscription through an in app purchase, your Payment Method will continue to be billed for the subscription until you cancel. After your initial subscription commitment period, your subscription will automatically continue for an indefinite period of time, at the price you agreed to when subscribing unless you cancel your subscription before the renewal date. Your card payment information will be stored and subsequently used for the automatic card payments in accordance with the Agreement.</p>
                        <p>Objections to a payment already made should be directed to Customer support if you were billed directly by Dating or the relevant third party account such as the App Store. You are also able to object by contacting your bank or payment provider, who can provide further information on your rights as well as applicable time limits. You may unconditionally withdraw your consent to automatic card payments at any time by going to Settings on Dating or the relevant third party account, but be advised that you are still obligated to pay any outstanding amounts.</p>
                        <p>If you want to change or terminate your subscription, it is easiest to log in to your third party account (or Settings on Dating, if applicable) and follow the instructions to terminate or cancel your subscription, even if you have otherwise deleted your account with us or if you have deleted the Dating application from your device. Deleting your account on Dating or deleting the Dating application from your device does not terminate or cancel your subscription; Dating will retain all funds charged to your Payment Method until you terminate or cancel your subscription on Dating or the third party account, as applicable. If you terminate or cancel your subscription, you may use your subscription until the end of your then-current subscription term, and your subscription will not be renewed after your then-current term expires.</p>
                        <p>For our members who reside in Germany, you may terminate your subscription after it has renewed with a notice period of one-month, and your right to terminate for cause remains unaffected.</p>
                        <p>Additional Terms that apply if you pay Dating directly with your Payment Method. If you pay Dating directly, Dating may correct any billing errors or mistakes that it makes even if it has already requested or received payment. If you initiate a chargeback or otherwise reverse a payment made with your Payment Method, Dating may terminate your account immediately in its sole discretion.</p>
                        <p>You may edit your Payment Method information by visiting Dating and going to Settings. If a payment is not successfully settled, due to expiration, insufficient funds, or otherwise, and you do not edit your Payment Method information, terminate or cancel your subscription, you remain responsible for any uncollected amounts and authorize us to continue billing the Payment Method, as it may be updated. This may result in a change to your payment billing dates. In addition, you authorize us to obtain updated or replacement expiration dates and card numbers for your credit or debit card as provided by your credit or debit card issuer. The terms of your payment will be based on your Payment Method and may be determined by agreements between you and the financial institution, credit card issuer or other provider of your chosen Payment Method. If you reside outside of the Americas, you agree that your payment to Dating will be through MTCH Technology Services Limited.</p>
                        <p><strong>Virtual Items.</strong> From time to time, you may be able to purchase or earn a limited, personal, non-transferable, non-sublicensable, revocable license to use "virtual items", which could include virtual products or virtual “coins” or other units that are exchangeable within the Service for virtual products (collectively, "Virtual Items"). Any Virtual Item balance shown in your account does not constitute a real-world balance or reflect any stored value, but instead constitutes a measurement of the extent of your license. Virtual Items do not incur fees for non-use, however, the license granted to you in Virtual Items will terminate in accordance with the terms of this Agreement, when Dating ceases providing the Service or your account is otherwise closed or terminated. Dating, in its sole discretion, reserves the right to charge fees for the right to access or use Virtual Items and may distribute Virtual Items with or without charge. Dating may manage, regulate, control, modify or eliminate Virtual Items at any time. Dating shall have no liability to you or any third party in the event that Dating exercises any such rights.

                        <p>You cannot cancel an order for delivery of digital content that is not delivered on a physical medium if order processing has begun with your explicit prior consent and acknowledgement that you will thereby lose your right of cancellation.

                        <p>If you made a purchase through a payment platform not listed above, please request a refund directly from the third-party merchant through which you made your purchase.</p>
                        <p>If you use your right of cancellation (except for purchases made through your Apple ID, which Apple controls), we will refund (or ask Google to refund) all payments received from you, without undue delay and in any case within 14 days of the date when we received notice of your decision to cancel the Agreement. We shall make such refund using the same means of payment as used by you in the initial transaction. In any case, no fees will be charged to you as a result of the refund.</p>
                        <p><strong>Pricing.</strong> Dating operates a global business, and our pricing varies by a number of factors.

                            <li class="mb-1">The exclusive means of resolving any dispute or claim arising out of or relating to this Agreement (including any alleged breach thereof) or the Service shall be BINDING ARBITRATION administered by JAMS under the JAMS Streamlined Arbitration Rules & Procedures, except as modified by our Arbitration Procedures. The one exception to the exclusivity of arbitration is that either party has the right to bring an individual claim against the other in a small claims court of competent jurisdiction, or, if filed in arbitration, the responding party may request that the dispute proceed in small claims court instead if the claim is within the jurisdiction of the small claims court. If the request to proceed in small claims court is made before an arbitrator has been appointed, the arbitration shall be administratively closed. If the request to proceed in small claims court is made after an arbitrator has been appointed, the arbitrator shall determine whether the dispute should remain in arbitration or instead be decided in small claims court. Such arbitration shall be conducted by written submissions only, unless either you or Dating elect to invoke the right to an oral hearing before the Arbitrator. But whether you choose arbitration or small claims court, you agree that you will not under any circumstances commence, or maintain, or participate in against the Company any class action, class arbitration, or other representative action or proceeding against Dating.</li>
                            <li class="mb-1">By using the Service in any manner, you agree to the above arbitration agreement. In doing so, YOU GIVE UP YOUR RIGHT TO GO TO COURT to assert or defend any claims between you and the Company (except for matters that may be taken to small-claims court). YOU ALSO GIVE UP YOUR RIGHT TO PARTICIPATE IN A CLASS ACTION OR OTHER CLASS PROCEEDING. If you assert a claim against Dating outside of small claims court (and Dating does not request that the claim be moved to small claims court), your rights will be determined by a NEUTRAL ARBITRATOR, NOT A JUDGE OR JURY, and the arbitrator shall determine all claims and all issues regarding the arbitrability of the dispute. You are entitled to a fair hearing before the arbitrator. The arbitrator can generally grant any relief that a court can, including the ability to hear a dispositive motion (which may include a dispositive motion based upon the parties’ pleadings, as well as a dispositive motion based upon the parties’ pleadings along with the evidence submitted), but you should note that arbitration proceedings are usually simpler and more streamlined than trials and other judicial proceedings. Decisions by the arbitrator are enforceable in court and may be overturned by a court only for very limited reasons. For details on the arbitration process, see our Arbitration Procedures.</li>
                            <li class="mb-1">Any proceeding to enforce this arbitration agreement, including any proceeding to confirm, modify, or vacate an arbitration award, may be commenced in any court of competent jurisdiction. In the event that this arbitration agreement is for any reason held to be unenforceable, any litigation against the Company (except for small-claims court actions) may be commenced only in the federal or state courts located in Dallas County, Texas. You hereby irrevocably consent to the jurisdiction of those courts for such purposes.</li>
